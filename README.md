transclusion-fixup
==================

An implementation of ID/IDREF fixup after transclusion

Processing documents with [XInclude 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude-11) introduces
the possibility of identifying where XInclude boundaries occur. Using this information,
it is possible to implement the ID/IDREF fixup described in the
[DocBook Transclusion](http://docbook.org/docs/transclusion/2010-12-09/transclusion.html)
document.

This project includes a stylesheet that does so. It's a work in progress.
